# Analysis of Housing Prices, Median Income, Population and Local Amenities in Los Angeles County

## Project Overview
This project aims to explore the interrelations between local amenities such as Trader Joe's stores, coffee shops, and stadiums, and housing prices across various zip codes in California.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Utilize APIs and datasets to gather comprehensive data by zip code.
